# Final Project for intrusion Detection Systems Fall 2025

## Team Members:
- Sarah Steadham
- Juliana Garza

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust, machine learning-based IDS for detecting malware hidden within encrypted network traffic by analyzing flow-level metadata. The system will integrate with a simulated threat intelligence feed to automatically enrich alerts with contextual data, providing security analysts with actionable insights beyond simple model predictions.
